# Overview


### How to use program

One of my friends is running a small business as a motorcycle mechanic. He needs a mobile app, so he can register his customers and then pull all the data out when customers come back to the store. On the main page, the admin can see different options such as Register customer, Update, View all, and delete a record. When the admin registers a new customer, an alert message will pop up notifying the Admin that the information has been recorded in the database. 

### Purpose
The purpose of writing this program is to show how SQL database can help us to keep records of all the customers and make our business more efficient.

# Relational Database

I used SQlite database for this project.SQLite is an open-source, zero-configuration, self-contained, stand-alone, transaction relational database engine designed to be embedded into an application.

### Structure
My program uses only one table. This table contains some columns: first name, last name, motorcycle maker, motorcycle mileage, and joining data. All the columns are text type. Since the Admin needs to know basic information such as customer information and motorcycle information, that is why I used this column.

# Development Environment

### Tools
* Visual Studio Code: This is an IDE, which helps me as an interface to program 
* Android Studio: This is an integrated environment designed especially for Android development. It was usefuil to run my code and see how the changes would see in the actual device.
* Guthub: Is the provider of internet hosting to save my code and manipulate my code online.

### Libraries

* React Native: This is a framework that combines the best-in-class JavasCript library for building an interface.
* React-native-sqlite-storage: This library helped me to connect React Native with SQLite database
* React-native-screens: This library was useful to expose native navigation container components to React Native

# Future Work

* User profile: Every User would be able to get access to their profile
* Alerts: Every User would receive an oil change notification after some time
* Upload photos and more information: Every user would have access to photos and exclusive information when the motorcycle when on a reparation.
